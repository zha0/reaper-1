## üöÄ About Reaper

Reaper is a powerful tool written in Python3, designed with OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) in mind. It leverages APIs and other public means to automatically seek and catalog information from across the internet and dark web. With its advanced data-scraping capabilities, reaper can quickly gather a wide range of information, including leaked GitHub commit data, phone numbers, DNS records, unique who-is requests, Shodan data, and even (soon) banking details. This makes reaper an essential tool for security researchers, investigators, and other professionals who need to quickly and efficiently gather intelligence for their work.

Using the request-module in Python, reaper automates the process of pulling data from various sources, and with its intuitive very-standard command line interface and powerful capabilities, it simplifies the process of scanning, collecting, analyzing, and storing large amounts of data it mines. Making it an indispensable tool for any OSINT project.

Whether you're a cybersecurity analyst, law enforcement officer, or private investigator, reaper can help you find the information you need to stay ahead of the curve. With its more advanced features being worked on and ease of use arguments in the command line, it's the perfect tool for anyone looking to harness the power of OSINT for their work.
 So why wait? Try reaper today and start reaping the benefits of better intelligence gathering!
